# `hitman-xtea`

Modified version of the standard [`XTEA`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XTEA) algorithm which works by inverting the direction of the delta in the middle of the algorithm (no other changes required other than the requisite delta to sum calculation).

Released for the purposes of assisting users with legitimate copies of the game to do legitimate things with their games.  Engineered using collision based attacks against block ciphered files (using 'Project Colander').
